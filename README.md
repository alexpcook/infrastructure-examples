# infrastructure-examples

This repository contains examples of infrastructure deployments I've worked on. They are loosely organized by area, such as AWS, Jenkins, Docker, and Terraform.

These examples are mostly experimental. More polished examples of these kinds of infrastructure deployments can be found in my [infrastructure-templates repo](https://github.com/alexpcook/infrastructure-templates).
